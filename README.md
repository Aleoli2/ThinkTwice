[![Demo](src/demo_start.png)](https://youtu.be/ZhSH63O4Hsg)

## Getting Started

- [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md)
- [Closed-Loop Evaluation in Carla](docs/EVAL.md)
- [Prepare Dataset](docs/DATA_PREP.md)
- [Train Your Own Model](docs/TRAIN.md)
- [Calibrations for Different Camera Settings](camera_calibration/README.md) (Optional)

## Quick Run in Carla

Install the environment as in [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md), download our checkpoint ([GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2bWf8qVwqVQxqM2GOKTiR9kE9nGtkYV/view?usp=share_link) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OamwKOUpqK0EOqWa1Luv_g)(提取码 m5di).) (189K frames training set), put it into **open_loop_training/ckpt**, and run:

```shell
## In the ThinkTwice/ directory
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  nohup bash ./leaderboard/scripts/evaluation_town05long.sh 22023 22033 thinktwice_agent  False True open_loop_training/ckpt/thinktwice.pth+open_loop_training/configs/thinktwice.py all_towns_traffic_scenarios_no256 thinktwice_town05long 2>&1 > thinktwice_town05long.log &
```

Check [closed_loop_eval_log/eval_log](closed_loop_eval_log/eval_log) to see how our model drives in Carla! :oncoming_automobile:

(In case you have a screen to see the interface of Carla simulator, you could remove *DISPLAY=* in [leaderboard/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py](leaderboard/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py) and then you could directly watch with Carla.)
